# Day 1 - Open & reproducible science

Teacher: Céline Acary Robert

## Overview

In an era where scientific discovery is driven by code, how can we ensure our results are more than just a "one-off"?
This talk explores the essential transition from "black box" scripts to transparent, reproducible research. We dive into the "reproducibility crisis," the power of the FAIR principles, and the technical pitfalls—from shifting dependencies to compiler quirks—that threaten scientific integrity. By mastering modern tools like version control, environment managers (Guix/Pixi), and long-term archiving via Software Heritage, you will learn how to build sustainable workflows that guarantee your science is credible, citable, and built to last.
