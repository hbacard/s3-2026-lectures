# Exercise 6 (Fast Prototyping)
1. Use the `main.py` from the pkoffee project to generate a repo structure.
2. Once you get the structure, ask the AI to provide a Python script that creates it.
3. Use the generated repo structure along with the main.py script to ask
the AI how to structure the code
4. Ask the AI for guidance on adopting the right mindset for generating
tests for this project. (Act as a Google engineer …)
5. Ask the AI to assess potential security issues for this project.
6. What are the available tools for security checks for this project? (Might
invent tools)
